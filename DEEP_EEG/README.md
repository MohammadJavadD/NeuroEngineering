# Deep Artificial Neural Network and EEG


For loading, preprocessing and visualization I use MNE toolbox (https://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html) and for Neural network, I use Tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org)

# TF_Keras_CNN_EEG_Trialwise_Decoding.ipynb
This is an implementation of "Deep learning with convolutional neural networks for EEG decoding and visualization" paper, using TF/Keras toolbox. It is a very simple and readable implementation. To read more, look at these References:
