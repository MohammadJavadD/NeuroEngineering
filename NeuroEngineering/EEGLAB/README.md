# The Simple code for extract a mean of PSD in EEGLAB

Someone need to estimate a mean of power in Frequency bands (Delta, Theta and...) for a specific channel or all channels and maybe tried to do so in EEGlab but they can only get the plot. This code is a way to get this data (mean value) exported. I used this question, see: https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_can_I_get_and_extract_a_mean_of_PSD_in_EEGlab
